You know how things are around here!<br>
0:07<br>
We’re always asking questions…<br>
0:09<br>
...and building things…<br>
0:11<br>
...and using our imaginations…<br>
0:12<br>
...and learning!<br>
0:13<br>
But today, we’re going to learn about people who get to do all of these things … all<br>
0:18<br>
of the time.<br>
0:19<br>
We’re going to learn how to think like engineers!<br>
0:21<br>
An engineer is a person who makes something that solves a problem.<br>
0:25<br>
Ugh.<br>
0:26<br>
Excuse me for just a moment …<br>
0:31<br>
OK, engineers make things that solve problems, and something that solves a problem is also<br>
0:37<br>
called a solution.<br>
0:38<br>
For example, let’s say there’s a city near a river, and across the river, there’s<br>
0:43<br>
another city.<br>
0:44<br>
People who live in one city need a way to cross the river to get to the other city!<br>
0:48<br>
To solve this problem, an engineer might design a bridge -- one that’s big and strong enough<br>
0:53<br>
to safely hold a lot of people -- plus all of their bikes and cars -- as they go across<br>
0:58<br>
the river.<br>
0:59<br>
So the bridge would be the solution to the problem.<br>
1:01<br>
Now, when they’re trying to find a solution to a problem, engineers don’t just make<br>
1:06<br>
a bunch of guesses.<br>
1:07<br>
They follow a series of steps to come up with the best possible solution.<br>
1:11<br>
Those steps are: ask, imagine, create, and improve!<br>
1:16<br>
Let’s see what kind of work an engineer does in each of these steps.<br>
1:21<br>
First, asking means simply asking questions about the problem— lots of questions!<br>
1:26<br>
These questions might be things like,<br>
1:27<br>
“What is the problem?”<br>
1:29<br>
“How will I know when I’ve solved it?”<br>
1:31<br>
and “What can I use to solve the problem?”<br>
1:34<br>
Engineers do the best they can to find answers to all of these questions.<br>
1:37<br>
Then, they move on to the next step—<br>
1:39<br>
They imagine.<br>
1:40<br>
I bet you’re good at imagining!<br>
1:42<br>
And if you are, you’re already thinking like an engineer!<br>
1:45<br>
Engineers have great imaginations— and they use them to think of many solutions to a problem.<br>
1:50<br>
In fact, they usually come up with a whole list of solutions.<br>
1:53<br>
Sometimes, an engineer might draw a picture of each idea -- to see how it would fit together,<br>
1:59<br>
and to help them imagine how it would work.<br>
2:02<br>
Then, they pick the idea they think might work the best.<br>
2:05<br>
Gosh, excuse me again!<br>
2:09<br>
Ok, next comes my favorite step.<br>
2:14<br>
After engineers imagine some solutions, they create!<br>
2:18<br>
Usually, engineers will start by making a model of what their idea would look like in<br>
2:22<br>
real life.<br>
2:23<br>
A model is something that looks or acts like a thing in the real world.<br>
2:27<br>
If you’ve ever used plastic bricks to make a building, then you’ve made a model of<br>
2:31<br>
a building.<br>
2:32<br>
Building a model bridge, for example, takes a lot less time and money than building a<br>
2:36<br>
real bridge.<br>
2:37<br>
So an engineer can use the model to see if their idea actually works, and solves the<br>
2:42<br>
problem.<br>
2:43<br>
But even if the idea does work, engineers still aren’t done.<br>
2:45<br>
They look at the model very closely to see if they can improve it, or make it better<br>
2:50<br>
in some way.<br>
2:51<br>
In the case of the bridge, they might see if they can design a bridge that’s safer<br>
2:54<br>
or stronger.<br>
2:55<br>
And if their idea doesn’t work, engineers don’t give up!<br>
2:59<br>
They can use parts of their idea that did work to come up with a new one.<br>
3:02<br>
Or they go back to their list of ideas and choose another one to build.<br>
3:06<br>
So, those steps again, that all engineers use to solve all kinds of problems, are: ask,<br>
3:12<br>
imagine, create, and improve!<br>
3:14<br>
Now, are you ready to start engineering?<br>
3:17<br>
Good!<br>
3:18<br>
Because we have a problem that needs a solution:<br>
3:21<br>
My back is really itchy!<br>
3:23<br>
And it’s itchy in this weird spot right in the middle ...and I can’t reach it!<br>
3:28<br>
I bet if we work together, we can think of a solution to this problem.<br>
3:33<br>
So let’s take the same first step that engineers take, and ask some questions!<br>
3:37<br>
First, what is the problem?<br>
3:39<br>
Well, I can’t reach where my back itches!<br>
3:41<br>
That’s a problem!<br>
3:43<br>
So, let’s ask another question.<br>
3:45<br>
How will we know if we’ve solved the problem?<br>
3:47<br>
That’s easy!<br>
3:48<br>
When I can reach the itchy spot on my back and scratch it...then the problem is solved.<br>
3:52<br>
Let’s ask one more question.<br>
3:54<br>
What things do we have to use to make our solution?<br>
3:58<br>
Well, Squeaks and I looked around the Fort to see what we could find.<br>
4:01<br>
We have a couple of rulers, some modeling dough, a pencil, a plastic fork, the cardboard<br>
4:08<br>
roll left from a roll of paper towels, and some tape.<br>
4:11<br>
These are some things we can use to come up with an idea.<br>
4:14<br>
Okay, let’s move on to step two: Imagine.<br>
4:16<br>
It’s time to put our thinking caps on to see what kinds of back scratchers we might<br>
4:21<br>
be able to make.<br>
4:22<br>
Squeaks and I each are going to take some time and draw a picture of a solution that<br>
4:25<br>
we think might work.<br>
4:26<br>
Why don’t you use that time to do the same thing?<br>
4:29<br>
Then, the next time we meet, we can share our ideas, and then do the next steps that<br>
4:33<br>
engineers do...we’ll build our back scratchers, test them to see if they solve the problem...and<br>
4:39<br>
then improve them to see if we can make them even better!<br>
4:42<br>
But don’t take too long!<br>
4:43<br>
My back is really itchy!!<br>
