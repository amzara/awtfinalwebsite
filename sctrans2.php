0:24<br>
me and my family we bacteria are living<br>
0:30<br>
things that cannot be seen with the<br>
0:33<br>
naked eye so you will need to use a<br>
0:37<br>
microscope to see us and this is why we<br>
0:40<br>
are also called<br>
0:41<br>
micro organisms we can be classified<br>
0:45<br>
into three groups according to our<br>
0:47<br>
shapes oh look my cousins are here too<br>

this mops coucher bacteria is called<br>
1:24<br>
Spiro sheet<br>
1:27<br>
they can move about really quickly but<br>
1:30<br>
most of them are pretty nasty<br>
1:32<br>
I suggest you avoid bumping into them<br>
1:36<br>
you can pardon us living in all sorts of<br>
1:40<br>
places some of us like it hot Wow some<br>
1:45<br>
of us like having fun in the course<br>
1:48<br>
enjoy swimming and some of us prefer to<br>
1:53<br>
hide in the stall<br>
1:54<br>

1:57<br>
inside your body unfortunately our jobs<br>
2:02<br>
might cause you to fall sick cousins<br>
2:07<br>
like to live on your home for example<br>
2:10<br>
this fish we need to break it down into<br>
2:13<br>
simpler substances so that we can absorb<br>
2:17<br>
them you see we can't make our own food<br>
2:21<br>
and that is why we need to feed all the<br>
2:24<br>
plants or animals that we go on<br>
2:26<br>
regardless of whether they are dead or<br>
2:29<br>
alive lucky for you some of us are good<br>
2:35<br>
we produce lactic acid to fight off the<br>
2:39<br>
harmful ones some of the good bacteria<br>
2:42<br>
work together with your immune system to<br>
2:45<br>
