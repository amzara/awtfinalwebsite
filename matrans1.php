15:34<br>
plants - carrot plants equals seven<br>
15:39<br>
carrot plants<br>
15:45<br>
ten minus three equals seven great math<br>
15:55<br>
10-carat plants - three carrot plants<br>
15:59<br>

16:14<br>
count our lettuce plants one two three<br>
16:25<br>

16:37<br>
six lettuce plants how many lettuce<br>
16:41<br>
plants do you think the bunny ate since<br>
16:43<br>
then let's do the math we started out<br>
16:48<br>
with six lettuce plants and now we have<br>
16:51<br>
only three lettuce plants left hmm let's<br>
16:55<br>
do the math six lettuce plants - lettuce<br>
17:02<br>
plants equals three lettuce plants<br>
17:10<br>
six minus three equals three you're<br>
17:14<br>

18:01<br>
plants Annie do you remember how many<br>
18:05<br>
carrot plants we had the last time we<br>
18:07<br>

18:33<br>
bunny<br>
18:34<br>
how many more carrots did he eat let's<br>
18:38<br>
do the math if we started out with seven<br>
18:43<br>
carrots and now we have only four left<br>
18:45<br>
how many carrots are missing seven<br>
18:50<br>
carrot plants - carrot plants equals<br>
18:55<br>
four carrot plants<br>
19:03<br>
seven minus three equals four great job<br>
19:13<br>
seven carrot plants - three carrot<br>
19:16<br>
plants equals four carrot plants the<br>
19:21<br>
answer is three how many carrots has<br>
19:25<br>
bunny eaten well he first ate three<br>
19:30<br>
carrots and now he has eaten three more<br>
19:32<br>
so let's do the math three carrot plants<br>
19:38<br>
plus three carrot plants equals carrot<br>
19:42<br>
plants<br>
19:49<br>
three plus three equals six great job<br>
19:58<br>
three carrot plants plus three carrot<br>
20:01<br>
plants equals six carrot plants six is<br>
20:07<br>
the correct answer that bunny has eaten<br>
20:11<br>
six of our 10 carats he must be a very<br>
20:15<br>

20:23<br>
how many lettuce plants has the bunny<br>
20:26<br>
eaten well he first ate four and then he<br>
20:31<br>
ate three more lettuce plants so let's<br>
20:34<br>
do the math for lettuce plants plus<br>
20:38<br>
three lettuce plants equals lettuce<br>
20:42<br>
plants<br>
20:48<br>
Wow you are so smart four plus three<br>
20:53<br>
equals seven<br>
