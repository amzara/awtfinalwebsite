Oh! Hey there!<br>
0:19<br>
You came right in time<br>
0:20<br>
we are planning to build a new cosy little home<br>
0:24<br>
and this will be a good chance to walk you through you our project.<br>
0:28<br>
Today,<br>
0:29<br>
we are going to focus on the physical properties of the materials<br>
0:33<br>
that we will be using to build our new home.<br>
0:38<br>
First things first,<br>
0:39<br>
let us choose the material to build a pillar.<br>
0:43<br>
Do you think we should use chalk to build the pillars?<br>
0:46<br>
Hmmm...<br>
0:47<br>
I don't think sooo....<br>
0:49<br>
Chalk is not a strong material<br>
0:52<br>
It will definitely break under heavy weights<br>
0:56<br>
We need to build pillars that are strong to keep this house standing.<br>
1:01<br>
Do you know what are some materials that are very strong?<br>
1:04<br>
Yes!<br>
1:05<br>
Concrete and steel are some strong materials that we can use to build our pillars.<br>
1:12<br>
They can support very very heavy weights!<br>
1:17<br>
Oh wow!<br>
1:18<br>
There is a huge swimming pool behind our house!<br>
1:21<br>
It’s a great place to have some fun!<br>
1:25<br>
I think we need a diving board for us to dive into the pool.<br>
1:29<br>
And this diving board has to be flexible enough, so that we can launch into the pool.<br>
1:36<br>
Do you think using glass is a good idea?<br>
1:39<br>
Nahhh!<br>
1:40<br>
It is definitely going to break when we jump on it.<br>
1:45<br>
OUCH!<br>
1:46<br>
So.<br>
1:47<br>
What material do you think is flexible enough to make our diving board?<br>
1:51<br>
Aha!<br>
1:53<br>
Plastic can be used to make the board as it is able to bend without breaking!<br>
1:59<br>
Looks like our diving board is ready!<br>
2:02<br>
Time to jump right into the pool!<br>
2:05<br>
WEEEEEEE!<br>
2:09<br>
Oh my!<br>
2:10<br>
We need a roof for our home.<br>
2:14<br>
What material can we use to build our roof?<br>
2:17<br>
I’m pretty sure we would wanna stay dry inside our house.<br>
2:22<br>
Do you think we can use sponge to build our roof?<br>
2:25<br>
Ah ah ah.<br>
2:26<br>
I don’t think that is a smart idea.<br>
2:28<br>
Sponge will absorb all the rain water and cause massive leaks into our house.<br>
2:34<br>
Hmmmm...<br>
2:36<br>
What material should we use then to build our roof?<br>
2:40<br>
We need something that is waterproof.<br>
2:43<br>
I know a material that is waterproof.<br>
2:46<br>
Plastic!<br>
2:48<br>
We can use plastic to build our roof!<br>
2:51<br>
Now, we can stay dry in our very own home.<br>
2:56<br>
Oh no!<br>
2:58<br>
I see a big bad wolf right outside our house!<br>
3:03<br>
We need a perfect door for our house to prevent this wolf from entering.<br>
3:09<br>
Do you think we should use plastic doors for the house?<br>
3:13<br>
I don’t think it’s a good idea!<br>
3:15<br>
Plastic materials are not suitable to make durable doors.<br>
3:20<br>
They are prone to scratches by pets and objects, and they do not last very long.<br>
3:26<br>
Hmm…<br>
3:27<br>
What other materials can we use to build our perfect door?<br>
3:33<br>
We can use metal or hardwood for the doors.<br>
3:37<br>
Metal or hardwood doors can withstand scratches,<br>
3:41<br>
maintain a clean and stylish look<br>
3:45<br>
And most importantly,<br>
3:47<br>
prevent intruders from entering our house.<br>
3:52<br>
Oh yes!<br>
3:53<br>
What about our windows?<br>
3:55<br>
Wouldn’t it be nice if we let natural light from the sun to brighten up our cozy little home?<br>
4:02<br>
Let us think.<br>
4:04<br>
Which type of material allows most light to pass through?<br>
4:08<br>
YES!<br>
4:09<br>
You are right! TRANSPARENT.<br>
4:11<br>
We need some TRANSPARENT windows.<br>
4:14<br>
And if you were thinking about GLASS.<br>
4:16<br>
Then, you are absolutely RIGHT again!<br>
4:20<br>
What if I do not want too much light?<br>
4:23<br>
I know!<br>
4:24<br>
We can use a material that is TRANSLUCENT.<br>
4:28<br>
But, do you think we can use wood or metal for our windows?<br>
4:33<br>
Nahhh.<br>
4:34<br>
They are OPAQUE and do not allow light to pass through.<br>
4:38<br>
Looks like we are settled with our windows!<br>
4:43<br>
Oh!<br>
4:43<br>
I see a beautiful lake just beside our house.<br>
4:48<br>
It is time to go on an adventure to explore the lake.<br>
4:52<br>
And for that,<br>
4:54<br>
we would need a BUOYANT vehicle!<br>
4:56<br>
And yes, that sounds like a boat.<br>
5:00<br>
We would need a material that is able to float on water.<br>
5:04<br>
I think wood is a great material to use for our boat.<br>
5:09<br>
Wood is less dense than water, allowing the boat to float.<br>
5:14<br>
How about metal?<br>
5:16<br>
Can we use metal for our little boat?<br>
5:19<br>
I don't think so!<br>
5:22<br>
Metal is denser than water, and our poor boat is going to sink.<br>
5:27<br>
That doesn’t sound like fun.<br>
5:31<br>
Hmmm…<br>
5:32<br>
I’m getting a little hungry.<br>
5:34<br>
Let’s have a barbeque party!<br>
5:37<br>
We need a good barbecue grill that can HEAT UP quickly.<br>
5:42<br>
What shall we use to make our grill?<br>
5:45<br>
Tada!<br>
5:47<br>
We can use steel for the barbecue grill.<br>
5:50<br>
Because steel is a good conductor of heat.<br>
5:54<br>
To handle the food, we will need tongs.<br>
5:58<br>
Should we use a metal tong?<br>
6:00<br>
OUCHHHH!<br>
6:03<br>
That hurts!<br>
6:04<br>
I think we need a material that is a poor conductor of heat<br>
6:08<br>
so that the tongs will not get too HOT and burn my hands.<br>
6:13<br>
Let us use a wooden tong!<br>
6:16<br>
Because wood is a poor conductor of heat.<br>
6:20<br>
Looks like we are ready for our barbeque party!<br>
6:25<br>
Oh!<br>
6:26<br>
It’s getting dark!<br>
6:27<br>
We need some lights in our house.<br>
6:30<br>
To light up the room, we can install light bulbs<br>
6:34<br>
connected to an electrical source!<br>
6:36<br>
We can use copper wires<br>
6:38<br>
to conduct electricity to our light bulbs,<br>
6:41<br>
as copper is an electrical conductor!<br>
6:46<br>
Oh, but are you sure that is safe?<br>
6:48<br>
Nah ah ah!<br>
6:49<br>
For safety, we can coat the copper wires with rubber,<br>
6:54<br>
as rubber is a great electrical insulator!<br>
7:04<br>
Well….<br>
7:05<br>
look at that.<br>
7:06<br>
Our little home is complete!<br>
7:09<br>
That looks like a wrap!<br>
7:10<br>
I hope you learnt a lot about<br>
7:13<br>
the physical properties of materials.<br>
7:16<br>
Thank you for being part of today’s project!<br>
7:20<br>
We will see you again next time for more lessons.<br>
7:24<br>
Oink, oink!<br>
