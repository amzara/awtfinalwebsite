How do we get around from place to place without having to walk everywhere?<br>
0:13<br>
How can we communicate with people who live far away?<br>
0:16<br>
These were problems that people struggled with for a long time, until recently.<br>
0:20<br>
Before there were things like cars, and phones, and computers. And you know who solved those problems?<br>
0:25<br>
Engineers.<br>
0:26<br>
But do you know what an engineer is?<br>
0:32<br>
The short answer is that an engineer is someone who wants to know how and why things work.<br>
0:37<br>
Now, I want to know how and why things work, but does that make me an engineer?<br>
0:41<br>
Not quite. Besides being naturally curious, an engineer is a person who designs and builds things like machines<br>
0:47<br>
or systems, or structures, that help solve a specific problem.<br>
0:50<br>
There's more than just one type of engineer, too.<br>
0:53<br>
But no matter what type of engineer someone is, they have to ask themselves<br>
0:57<br>
three very important questions when they're working.<br>
0:59<br>
1. What is the problem that needs to be solved?<br>
1:02<br>
2. Who has the problem that needs to be solved?<br>
1:05<br>
And most importantly<br>
1:06<br>
3. Why is this problem important to solve?<br>
1:09<br>
Let's take a look at some examples.<br>
1:15<br>
A really famous example of engineering is the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, California.<br>
1:20<br>
I mentioned that there are different kinds of engineers, and the civil engineer is someone<br>
1:24<br>
who designs and constructs buildings, roads and, yep, bridges<br>
1:27<br>
For the person who designed the Golden Gate Bridge, what was the problem that they needed to solve?<br>
1:31<br>
People couldn't travel in or out of San Francisco, which is surrounded on most sides by water, without a boat.<br>
1:36<br>
Who had the problem?<br>
1:37<br>
Residents of San Francisco, mostly, but really anybody traveling in the area.<br>
1:42<br>
Why was the problem important to solve?<br>
1:44<br>
Well you didn't want a whole bunch of San Fransisco residents trapped in San Fransisco forever.<br>
1:48<br>
Even if it's a super cool city.<br>
1:49<br>
Plus you wanted people outside of San Fransisco to be able to travel to the city easily if they needed to.<br>
1:55<br>
So the Golden Gate Bridge was engineered as a solution to this problem<br>
1:59<br>
In addition to civil engineers, there are also mechanical, electrical, chemical, computer, nuclear, and software engineers.<br>
2:05<br>
And the list goes on<br>
2:07<br>
Let's talk about what some of the other types of engineers do. First up, electrical engineers.<br>
2:12<br>
Electrical engineers study electricity. They design electrical systems like circuits and computer chips.<br>
2:17<br>
Think of an electrical object that you use pretty regularly.<br>
2:19<br>
How about your microwave? What problem was the microwave a solution to?<br>
2:23<br>
Cold food, right?<br>
2:24<br>
You have an electrical engineer to thank for the ability to reheat that leftover pizza you just had for lunch.<br>
2:30<br>
But while you might not have heard of Joseph Strauss or Percy Spencer,<br>
2:33<br>
the engineers responsible for the Golden Gate Bridge and the microwave respectively,<br>
2:36<br>
You`ve probably heard of Henry Ford. As in Ford cars.<br>
2:40<br>
Henry Ford was a mechanical engineer, or someone working in a manufacturing industry,<br>
2:44<br>
making mechanical things like tools, engines and machines.<br>
2:47<br>
Machines like cars.<br>
2:49<br>
Ford didn`t invent the automobile, but his Ford Motor Company made a lot of them.<br>
2:54<br>
His Model T car was famous for being affordable for plenty of Americans.<br>
2:57<br>
Ford saw that lots of people who wanted to drive cars, just couldn`t. Because they couldn`t afford the pricey vehicles that were for sale.<br>
3:04<br>
So he engineered a cheaper model as a solution to this problem.<br>
3:07<br>
His fellow engineers started to do the same and now, well, car are everywhere.<br>
3:12<br>
Henry Ford`s was not the only big name engineer.<br>
3:15<br>
A famous engineer around today is Marissa Mayer.<br>
3:17<br>
Mayer is the president of the internet company Yahoo, and is also a software engineer.<br>
3:22<br>
Software engineers work on computers and other products that use software<br>
3:26<br>
to write programs to make them faster and able to do more things.<br>
3:33<br>
No matter what kind of engineer someone is,<br>
3:35<br>
their job at it`s most basic level is problem-solving.<br>
3:39<br>
Each engineer just specializes in solving certain kinds of problems.<br>
3:43<br>
While it might seem like there are too many types of engineers to keep track of,<br>
3:46<br>
just wait 15 years, or 50, or 100.<br>
3:50<br>
Because we will probably have a ton of different types to add to the list by then.<br>
3:54<br>
Think about it. Over a 100 years ago we didn`t have jobs in fields like aerospace engineering<br>
3:58<br>
where people design and construct planes and spacecraft.<br>
4:01<br>
We didn`t have planes like we do today, or need spaceships. So we didn`t need people to engineer them.<br>
4:06<br>
Who knows what machines or tools or everyday objects we will have in the year 3015?<br>
4:11<br>
Personally, I`m hoping for underwater cities.<br>
4:13<br>
But whatever these things are, we will need engineers to make them.<br>
4:16<br>
So what do you say?<br>
4:17<br>
Who wants to be an engineer?<br>
